I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for including me in the Quarterly Excellence Award for our Datacenter Migration project. Your decision to nominate me, even though I had completed the entire project and moved to a new team three months ago, has truly touched me.
Vasantha, your leadership throughout the project was exceptional. I am particularly grateful for your continued recognition of my contributions, even after the project's completion and my subsequent transition. This speaks volumes about your inclusive leadership style and your commitment to acknowledging team efforts, regardless of current team affiliations.
Raja, your expertise as our Business Analyst was crucial to our success. I appreciate that you valued my input enough to include me in this nomination, despite the project being finished and me having moved on. It demonstrates the strong professional relationship we built and the lasting impact of our collaboration.
Your decision to include me in this accolade is truly meaningful. You could have easily focused solely on the current team members, but you chose to recognize everyone who contributed to the project's success, including those who have since moved on. This gesture of inclusion resonates deeply with me.
This award is indeed a testament to our collective efforts, and I am genuinely grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to this successful endeavor from start to finish. The fact that you remembered and valued my input, even months after the project's completion and my team transition, reinforces the strong bonds and mutual respect we developed during our time working together.
Thank you once again for this unexpected and deeply appreciated recognition. Your consideration has left a lasting impact on me and reinforces the positive memories I have of our time working on the Datacenter Migration project.
