Liquibase Database Migration Strategy
Master Configuration
âœ¨ Single Source of Truth

One master changelog file controls all database changes
Each release gets its own changelog file
Cached for 60 minutes to optimize performance

Change Management Strategy
ðŸŽ¯ Release-Based Organization

Changes organized by release versions (e.g., 202501, 202502)
Multiple changelog files per release for better maintainability
Example: changelog-202501-1.yml, changelog-202501-2.yml

Folder Structure Best Practices
ðŸ“‚ Clean Separation
Copy/resources
    /db
        /changelog
            /release-202501/
            /release-202502/
        /scripts

Separates SQL scripts from changelog definitions
Each release in its own folder
Easy to track, review, and rollback changes

Change Implementation
ðŸ”„ Ordered Execution Pattern

Create new tables/schema
Data migration/insertion
Cleanup old schema
